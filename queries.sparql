Competency Questions and Queries
1: What are the different types of damages that can occur to a car?

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ocd: <https://developer.iziflo.com/research/ocd/>

SELECT ?damageType
WHERE {
  ?damageType rdf:type ocd:Damage .
}

2: What are the various car parts that can be affected by damages?
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ocd: <https://developer.iziflo.com/research/ocd/>

SELECT ?carPart
WHERE {
  ?carPart rdf:type ocd:CarParts .
}
Explanation: This query retrieves all instances of the class ocd:CarParts, representing the various car parts that can be affected by damages.

3: How severe is each type of damage?
(Assuming there is a property named ocd:Severity to represent the severity of a damage type.)

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ocd: <https://developer.iziflo.com/research/ocd/>

SELECT ?damageType ?severity
WHERE {
  ?damageType rdf:type ocd:Damage .
  ?damageType ocd:Severity ?severity .
}
Explanation: This query retrieves the severity of each type of damage by selecting instances of ocd:Damage and their associated severity using the property ocd:Severity.

4: What are the possible relationships between car parts and damages?
(Assuming there is a property named ocd:hasDamage to represent the relationship between car parts and damages.)

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ocd: <https://developer.iziflo.com/research/ocd/>

SELECT ?carPart ?damageType
WHERE {
  ?carPart rdf:type ocd:CarParts .
  ?carPart ocd:hasDamage ?damageType .
}
Explanation: This query retrieves instances of ocd:CarParts that are related to specific damage types through the property ocd:hasDamage.

5: How can the extracted information from unstructured reports be linked to specific concepts in the ontology?
(The answer depends on the method used for extraction. Assuming a property named ocd:hasExtractedInformation for linking unstructured reports to ontology concepts.)

PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ocd: <https://developer.iziflo.com/research/ocd/>

SELECT ?carBrand ?carModel ?carRegistration 
?carPartName ?place ?damageType ?severity 
?repairAction WHERE { ?car rdf:type ocd:Car .
  ?car ocd:CarBrand ?carBrand .
  ?car ocd:CarModel ?carModel .
  ?car ocd:CarRegistration ?carRegistration .
  FILTER (CONTAINS(?carRegistration, "FR-759-803"))
  ?car ocd:hasCarPart ?carPart .
  ?carPart rdf:type ocd:CarParts .
  ?carPart ocd:PartName ?carPartName .
  ?carPart ocd:hasDamage ?damage .
  ?damage rdf:type ocd:Damage .
  ?damage ocd:DamageType ?damageType .
  OPTIONAL {?carPart ocd:Place ?place .}
  OPTIONAL {?damage ocd:RepairAction ?repairAction .}
  OPTIONAL {?damage ocd:Severity ?severity .}}
Explanation: This query retrieves instances of ocd:UnstructuredReport and the associated extracted information using the property ocd:hasExtractedInformation.

6: How can the ontology be used to enhance the accuracy and relevance of extracted relations between car components and damages?
(This question will be addressed in an upcoming article titled "Information Extraction from Automotive Reports for Ontology Population." In the imminent publication, we delve into the pivotal role of our ontology, the Ontology for Car Damage (OCD), in refining the accuracy and relevance of extracted relationships. )

7: What is the overall structure and hierarchy of car components and damage types within the ontology?
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ocd: <https://developer.iziflo.com/research/ocd/>

SELECT ?class ?subclass
WHERE {
  ?subclass rdfs:subClassOf ?class .
  VALUES ?class { ocd:CarParts ocd:Damage }
}
SPARQL Query for Damage Price Prediction
This SPARQL query retrieves data relevant for predicting damage repair prices. It includes details about cars, their attributes, parts, and damages. The retrieved information can be used to build a dataset for regression analysis to predict damage repair costs.
